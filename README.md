# ðŸ‘‹ðŸ˜ƒ Hi, I'm I-May!

## Who am I?
I'm a dedicated learner navigating the expansive realm of programming. My journey has been a mix of frustration, excitement, determination, and the occasional dose of disappointment. Starting with little programming experience and diving headfirst into Android development, I've weathered the storm of constant changes and challenges.

## My Interests
### 1. Making Tools for Workflow Enhancement
I'm on a mission to create tools that enhance workflow and improve the quality of life during development. Inspired by JetBrains, whose tools have been pivotal in my journey, I aim to contribute to the development community with my own solutions.

### 2. Desktop Audio Applications Enthusiast
My aspirations include building desktop audio applications. From crafting VST plugins to dreaming of creating my own DAW, my path involves mastering C++ and delving into various aspects of audio application development.

### 3. Current Android Project - Delta (Powered by CRAKD)
I'm currently engrossed in an Android application project, internally named Delta, powered by the CRAKD (Compose, Realm, Android, Kotlin, Dagger) tech stack. CRAKD is my own goofy nickname for this combination of technologies.

## Learning Journey
My learning journey has been a rollercoaster. From grappling with the fundamentals of Android development to mastering Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, and navigating the ever-evolving landscape, it's been a mix of breakthroughs and bug fixes. Room puzzled me, leading me to Realm after an extensive search for alternatives. Despite the tumult, accessible and beginner-friendly resources have kept me trudging along, making progress day by day.

## Git and GitHub
I'm relatively new to Git and GitHub, but I'm determined to change that by actively using the platform. Expect more projects (and maybe even collaborations) in the near future.

## Beyond Coding
My interests extend beyond coding, encompassing music production and gaming. While I don't currently have functional projects to showcase, I'm gearing up to share my creations with the world.

Feel free to explore my repositories and join me on this coding odyssey! ðŸš€
